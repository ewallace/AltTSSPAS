This repository is for estimates of alternate transcription start site and polyadenylation sites in fungi.

The question: does the relative use of different possible mRNA ends change between conditions?

The stats work was started in February 2018.

# Contents

## data

data: un-normalized counts of TSS and PAS usage in various conditions

## src

scripts to analyze data, mostly in .Rmd format

## results

results: estimation of differentially used termini

# To-do

    - add data
    - add .Rmd files from 2018
    - check original .Rmd files run on data
    - expand to zero-inflated model

This repository is for estimates of alternate transcription start site and polyadenylation sites in fungi.

The question: does the relative use of different mRNA end sites change between conditions?

The stats work was started in February 2018. Picked up again in July 2019.

# Contents

## data

un-normalized counts of TSS and PAS usage in various conditions

## src

scripts to analyze data, mostly in .Rmd format

## results

estimation of differentially used termini

# To-do

    [ ] add data
    [ ] add .Rmd files from 2018
    [ ] check original .Rmd files run on data
    [ ] expand to zero-inflated model?
    [ ] assess effect on start codon usage (alt N-termini)
    [ ] assess effect on protein localization
